production use cases which can be used from clojure (via interop).

### Motivation

At this stage it's just to explore FQL in clojure.

### Planned Features

- minimal dep requirements. Java 11, Clojure, data.json
- FQL implemented as clojure functions
- Macros for making FQL more like familiar clojure
- Spec validated FQL at dev time
